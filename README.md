Here To There Pebble watchapp

Here is the sourcecode for my XDA Pebble Developer contest. To have a working build, you need to get a
developer API key from http://developer.here.com. You will then need to input your app_id and app_code
on line 107 and 108 of the js file. The app also includes a configuration screen so you can set your locations.
Right now I am hosting this file on my server.

If you have any questions or issues, please log one here and I will look at fixing it. Enjoy!
